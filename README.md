# Notion MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation for Notion integration, providing a standardized interface for interacting with Notion's API. Compatible with Claude Desktop and other MCP clients.

## Features

- List and query Notion databases
- Create and update pages
- Search across Notion workspace
- Get database details and block children
- Full async/await support with httpx
- Type-safe with Pydantic v2 models
- Proper error handling with detailed logging
- Compatibility with MCP 1.6.0

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ccabanillas/notion-mcp.git
cd notion-mcp
```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies (using uv):
```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
uv pip install -e .
```

Alternatively, using standard venv:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```bash
NOTION_API_KEY=your_notion_integration_token
```

## Usage

1. Test the server (it should run without errors):
```bash
python -m notion_mcp
```

2. To use it with Claude Desktop, adjust your `claude_desktop_config.json` file (located at `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on macOS):

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "notion-mcp": {
      "command": "/Users/username/Projects/notion-mcp/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": ["-m", "notion_mcp"],
      "cwd": "/Users/username/Projects/notion-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Be sure to replace `/Users/username/` with your actual home directory path.

```

### Running Tests

```bash
pytest
```

## Configuration

The server requires a Notion integration token. To set this up:

1. Go to https://www.notion.so/my-integrations
2. Create a new integration with appropriate capabilities (read/write as needed)
3. Copy the integration token
4. Add it to your `.env` file in the project root directory:

```
NOTION_API_KEY=your_notion_integration_token
```

5. Share your Notion databases with the integration (from the database's "Share" menu)

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Connection Errors**: Make sure your Notion API key is correct and you have internet access
- **Permission Errors**: Ensure your integration has been given access to the databases you're trying to access
- **Claude Desktop Integration**: If Claude Desktop isn't connecting, check that your config path is correct and that the server is running without logging to stdout
